    My goal is to provide some guidance to people interested in prototyping their
    new app idea.  Throughout this post, I will identify useful tactics, concepts,
    and resources.  This is in no way comprehensive, but hopefully it gets you
    started.  Below are some of the topics that I will cover.

    <li>Testing (Alpha and Beta)</li>

<h3>Why Prototyping is Important</h3>
<p>
  Prototyping allows developers to bring their idea to life.  Many times, people
  hesitate to release a usable version of their idea until everything is perfect.
  However, developing a usable product or service is the only way for us to learn.  If
  you have a spare hour, and I highly recommend the
  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/223/">Fake It Till You Make It</a> talk.
  This talk discusses and demonstrates Apple's prototyping process, and took place in 2014 at
  the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).  You may need to use Safari to view
  the video...

<h3>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h3>
<p>
  The MVP is usually the first iteration of a new product.  Basically, the MVP
  answers this question: How can we learn the most about our product, and customers,
  with the least amount of effort?  The MVP gives us a chance to
  prove our value proposition.  Sometimes people have found a solution to
  a problem that no one has.  The MVP helps us avoid going down that path too long.
  Take your original idea, with all of its features, and refactor it to the most basic form.
  Although we are aiming for simplicity, it is important that the MVP still
  communicates the intended value of the product.
</p>

<h3>Testing (Alpha and Beta)</h3>
<p>
  Now that we have our MVP, we want to test it.  Testing allows us to learn more about the
  product and the people that use the product.  After gaining feedback from our testing, we restart the cycle; Prototype - MVP
  - Testing.  Maybe we learned that no one understands our value proposition, or possibly everyone
  mentioned that "this" feature would make the product so much better.  Without testing,
  we can't benefit from user feedback and move forward with confidence.
</p>

<p>
  Testing can be split into two groups, Alpha and Beta.  You can think of Alpha as internal testing and
  Beta as external testing.  Commonly, Alpha testing is performed by people internal to the
  company (e.g. engineers, designers, and managers).  This gives us the benefit of feedback
  in a controlled environment.  Beta testing is usually done after we have gone through many
  iterations of the product development, and feel that we are ready to introduce it to the public.

<h3>Business Model Canvas</h3>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf ">Business Model Canvas</a>
   (BMC) is a framework used for developing a new
  product/service/business and for analyzing existing products/services/
  businesses.  The framework helps people flesh out their initial concept and
  develop a workable business model.  The framework contains nine
  boxes: Key Partners, Key Activities, Key Resources, Value Propositions,
  Customer Relationships, Channels, Customer Segments, Cost Structure, and
  Revenue Streams.  I found the best way to use this framework is to simply
  draw it out on a whiteboard and add post-it notes to each of the boxes.  This
  framework should help you analyze your product or service from different perspectives.
