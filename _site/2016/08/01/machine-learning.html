<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<p>August 01, 2016</p>
<p>
In the following post I will analyze Machine Learning as a technology. Machine
Learning can be considered a component of Artificial Intelligence, and a subset
of Computer Science and Statistics. Tom M. Mitchell, professor of Computer
Science at Carnegie Mellon University, defines Machine learning through this
central question: “How can we build computer systems that automatically improve
with experience, and what are the fundamental laws that govern all learning
processes?” <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/pubs/MachineLearning.pdf">
(Mitchell, 2006)</a>. Essentially, Machine Learning uses mathematical
algorithms in order to make adaptable predictions and observations from large
data sets. In my analysis, I will discuss the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Technological Utility</li>
  <li>History and Evolution</li>
  <li>Disruptive Opportunities</li>
  <li>Business Applications</li>
  <li>Risks and Challenges</li>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technological Utility</h3>
<p>
In order to examine the utility of Machine Learning, we must understand the
technology’s features and mechanics. Machine Learning is often confused with
Predictive Analysis. This stems from the fact that “machine learning is about
learning to do better in the future based on what was experienced in the past”
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr08/cos511/scribe_notes/0204.pdf">
(Schapire, 2008)</a>. The key differentiating word is ‘learning’. Predictive
analysis will extrapolate on large data sets, allowing management to make
educated strategic plans. Therefore, Predictive Analysis deals more with inputs
and outputs, whereas Machine Learning utilizes mathematical algorithms in order
to continuously improve upon predictive functions. As such, Machine Learning is
adaptable, whereas Predictive Analysis can only perform programmed instructions.
 Another way of viewing the two principles is that Predictive Analysis is
 ‘manual’ and Machine Learning is ‘automatic’.
</p>
<h3>History and Evolution</h3>
<p>
Historically, Machine Learning was simply a theoretical academic discipline,
rather than a real-world technology. As mentioned earlier, Machine Learning
relies on large amounts of data and learning algorithms. Therefore, due to the
fact that large data sets (Big Data) are becoming available with social
networking and online activity, Machine Learning has transitioned quickly from
theoretical study to practical application.
</p>
<p>
In order to foster continuous improvement, or learning, machines require more
and more data. A pivotal realization is that Machine Learning has transitioned
from supervised learning to self-learning, or unsupervised learning. Supervised
learning is when “an algorithm is first trained on a large set of data that has
been annotated by a human and then is let loose on other, unstructured data”
<a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2013/07/15/machine-learning-change-the-game.aspx">
(Kakaes, 2013)</a>.
</p>
<p>
A good example is the process used in the ImageNet competition where “teams
train computer programs on a data set of about 1 million images that have each
been manually labeled with a category. After training, the programs are tested
by getting them to suggest labels for similar images that they have never seen
before” <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/computer-science-the-learning-machines-1.14481">
(Jones, 2014)</a>. In this example of supervised learning, the computer
system was given structured data, images with labels, in order to recognized
unstructured data, images outside of the learning set.
</p>
<p>
In unsupervised learning, there is no initial step consisting of structured
data. Therefore, unsupervised learning essentially skips a step. A good example
for unsupervised learning is Google Brain, “a network of 1,000 computers
programmed to soak up the world much as a human toddler does”
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/computer-science-the-learning-machines-1.14481">
(Jones, 2014)</a>.
Google Brain utilizes deep learning, a branch of machine learning, in order to
execute unsupervised learning. Essentially, deep learning breaks down data into
multiple layers in order to establish defining categories.
</p>
<h3>Disruptive Opportunities</h3>
<p>
Machine Learning itself may not be considered inherently disruptive, however
the application of Machine Learning can allow various businesses to become
disruptive. Examples include Amazon making marketplace purchase recommendations
or iTunes making music purchase recommendations. I left out Netflix’s
application of Machine learning because their viewing recommendations are not
directly correlated or linked to a revenue stream. A comparable example of a
technology that is not inherently disruptive, but allows businesses to become
disruptive, is Global Positioning System (GPS). Companies such as Uber employ
GPS, or location services, in order to better serve their customer base. This
has allowed Uber to become a truly on-demand taxi service.
</p>
<p>
A good example is Apple’s ‘Siri’ and Google’s ‘Google Now’. Both Software as a
Service (SaaS) systems attempt to provide every consumer with a personal
assistant. A venture capitalist comments, “with a simple prompt or voice
command, [he] can now set an appointment, place a call, play music, type
messages, analyze [his] schedule, and perform a search for virtually anything”
<a href="http://blog.openviewpartners.com/machine-learning-is-the-next-big-disruption/">
(Maxwell, 2015)</a>. The amazing feature is that through machine learning,
these applications can gather and analyze consumer data and habits in order to
deliver services before they are requested. Therefore, these applications can
predict consumer wants and needs on a personalized level. Additionally, these
applications of Machine Learning can satisfy the B2B market.
</p>
<p>
With the advent of SaaS, companies have more data now than ever before;
“what continues to be a challenge, however, is converting that data into
something useful or meaningful”
<a href="http://blog.openviewpartners.com/machine-learning-is-the-next-big-disruption/">
(Maxwell, 2015)</a>. This dilemma is where Machine Learning can help companies
convert data into a disruptive technology. By using Machine Learning to satisfy
potential needs and wants of customers, companies can create a disruptive model
that outcompetes their competitors. However, there is a chance that utilizing
Machine Learning becomes simply a way to keep up with competitors, rather
than create a true disruption.
</p>
<h3>Business Applications</h3>
<p>
Many businesses have utilized Machine Learning in order to improve their
operational efficiency, provide innovative services to their customers, and
support strategic initiatives.  The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a
terrific example of an organization using Machine Learning to improve
operational efficiency. The USPS uses an application of Machine Learning,
computer vision, in order to better process handwritten addresses;
“over 85% of handwritten mail in the US is sorted automatically, using
handwriting analysis software trained to very high accuracy using machine
learning over a very large data set”
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/pubs/MachineLearning.pdf">(Mitchell, 2006).</a>
</p>
<p>
In addition to Google Now, Google has developed Google Inbox with ‘Smart Reply’;
 “Google's servers will scan your e-mails, generate three short responses, and
 stick them at the bottom of the screen or just above the keyboard”
 <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/11/google-inbox-will-reply-to-e-mails-for-you-with-machine-learning/">(Amadeo, 2015)</a>.
  This goes back to our discussion of supervised and unsupervised learning.
  With Google Inbox, the service can scan unstructured data in order to produce
  a suggestion. Again, this is another example of a way companies are utilizing
   Machine Learning in order to bring customers innovative services.
</p>
<p>
Another example is Persado; a machine learning service allowing businesses to
construct automated personable e-mails. Essentially, Persado scans “huge
amounts of customer data to identify the key phrases, language, emotions, and
product features that are most likely to resonate with individual buyers”
<a href="http://blog.openviewpartners.com/machine-learning-is-the-next-big-disruption/">
(Maxwell, 2015)</a>. This is a B2B Machine Learning solution that could help
companies, small and large, better focus their strategic marketing efforts.
</p>
<p>
  NEC’s NeoFace is a facial recognition software that utilizes similar
  principles as Google Brain. Both technologies utilize deep learning, a
  subset of Machine Learning. As we discussed earlier, deep learning will
  synthesize data through various layers and then establish categories for data
  sets; NeoFace works by “deconstructing faces into characteristic
  constituents, called eigenfaces, in a way roughly analogous to the grid
  coordinates of a point”
  <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2013/07/15/machine-learning-change-the-game.aspx">
  (Kakaes, 2013)</a>. Presently, NeoFace is more applicable to government and
  law enforcement. However, it is clear that this technology could be harnessed
  by businesses for marketing or fraud protection services.
</p>
<p>
Many companies are employing Machine Learning in order to produce self-driving
cars. Google’s Self-Driving Car Project offers many potential benefits to
consumers. First, self-driving cars would allow people who can no longer drive
the same flexibility and independence as other drivers. Also, Google predicts
that self-driving cars would significantly reduce traffic accidents, “especially
 since 94% of accidents in the U.S. involve human error”
 <a href="https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/">(Google S-DCP)</a>.
</p>
<p>
Both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure offer Machine Learning
products. This is where the line between Machine Learning and Predictive
Analysis becomes blurry. Both companies seem to take more of a hybrid than a
purist approach, which makes sense. In an academic setting, it is worthwhile
to make the distinction between Machine Learning and Predictive Analysis.
However, in application, both Amazon and Microsoft can better serve their
commercial customers through the hybrid approach; there is no reason to draw
distinct lines between the two technologies.
</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>
There are risks and challenges associated with both the implementation and
usage of Machine Learning at the commercial level. A primary consideration
is: what is the motivation behind adopting Machine Learning as a technology?
Companies must assess why they need it and how they plan to use it;
executives must “see it as a tool to craft and implement a strategic vision”
<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/an_executives_guide_to_machine_learning ">(Pyle, San Jose, 2015)</a>.
 By viewing Machine Learning as a strategic tool, companies can avoid the
 technology from becoming limited to an operational mechanism. As we have seen
 in the build vs. buy debate, companies often buy a product that exceeds their
 needs. Therefore, due diligence is a requirement for successful implementation
 of Machine Learning technology.
</p>
<p>
In order for a company to fully utilize Machine Learning as a technology, they
must have access to large amounts of data. The data is the initial input
needed in order for applications of Machine Learning to properly work. Although,
 how do companies know that their data is accurate? This is a challenge that
 many companies face. An associated risk would be to rely on inaccurate data in
 order to make predictions or utilize other components of Machine Learning.
</p>
<p>
Another challenge associated with Machine Learning is the way in which it will
require management to change how they deal with strategic planning initiatives.
The benefits that Machine Learning may deliver could leave management with
unforeseen options and information to consider. Therefore, it is crucial to
have employees that can translate the results; “while the machine identifies
patterns, the human translator’s responsibility will be to interpret them for
different microsegments and to recommend a course of action”
<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/an_executives_guide_to_machine_learning ">(Pyle, San Jose, 2015)</a>.
 The important takeaway is that an investment in Machine Learning will most
 likely require an investment in employees who can fully utilize the technology.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Machine Learning offers many businesses an opportunity to better understand
their customers. Successful implementation of Machine
Learning technology could help companies become disruptive, gain a competitive
advantage, or simply keep up with the demands of competition. Ultimately,
executives must assess how Machine Learning fits with their overall strategic
goals. Additionally, successful implementation requires that a company invest
in their employees. Machine Learning provides many automated capabilities,
however success depends on the human component.
